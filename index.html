            <p class="introductory-paragraph">
              I'm a person who has always been interested in tech, since I was
              young I have always had interest in learning how th y hy be
              computer works, how it is able to carry out all the commands just
              by yhthe single click by user. We did not have many computers to
              learn from wb1hen growing up so i had to watch from a distance.
            </p>
            <p class="introductory-paragraph">
              However like people say, "nothing stays the same", when i grew
              older i finally found myself in an area where they is lots of
              access to tech and got my hands on a computer and now I can
              confidently say I have learned a lot and believe I can tell the
              computer what to do and how I want it done, which is something I
              have always wanted, because I am a person who clicks a button and
              if it makes a click sound, I will want to know why it made that
              sound.
            </p>

            <p class="introductory-paragraph">
              They say "curiosity killed the cat" but the same cut is never
              taken by surprise, it always lands on its feet, that is the kind
              of person I am, that is who i want to be, someone who is flexible,
              because I beleive a flexible person is who is needed in this ever
              changing world.
